    <h2>What is this?</h1>
    <h3> 
	    A way for you to immortalize your message on the blockchain. <br> 
	    Write <i> whatever</i> you want. <br>
	    A smart contract instantly stores the newest message on the blockchain, if your bid is highest. <br>
	    This website displays the latest message. <br>
	    Nobody can stop it or turn it off, including me! <br>
    </h3>
    <h2>How does it work?</h1>
    <h3> 
	    Running on the ethereum blockcain is the smart contract with address <insert addr> which compares every incoming transaction with previous maximum value.
	    If your value is higher, smart contract stores your message in the blockchain. <br> 
	    The previous message is still in the blockchain, but only the last one is displayed on the website.
    </h3>
    <h2>What if I send insufficient funds/somebody raises the top price seconds before me?</h1>
    <h3> 
	    Smart contract refunds you.
    </h3>
    <h2>Is the code open source?</h1>
    <h3> 
	    Yes.
	    Smart contract source code is here. <br>
	    You can also convince yourself that the website source (CTRL+u if you're in Chrome) doesn't do anything funny.
